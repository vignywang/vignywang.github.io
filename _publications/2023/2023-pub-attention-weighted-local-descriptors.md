  Local features detection and description are widely used in many vision applications with high industrial and commercial demands. With large-scale applications, these tasks raise high expectations for both the accuracy and speed of local features. Most existing studies on local features learning focus on the local descriptions of individual keypoints, which neglect their relationships established from global spatial awareness. In this paper, we present AWDesc with a consistent attention mechanism (CoAM) that opens up the possibility for local descriptors to embrace image-level spatial awareness in both the training and matching stages. For local features detection, we adopt local features detection with feature pyramid to obtain more stable and accurate keypoints localization. For local features description, we provide two versions of AWDesc to cope with different accuracy and speed requirements. On the one hand …
