  Automatically extracting roads from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images is of great importance in a wide range of remote sensing applications. However, complex shapes of roads (i.e., long, geometrically deformed, and thin) always affected the extraction accuracy, which is one of the challenges of road extraction. Based on the insight into road shape characteristics, we propose a novel road shape-aware network (RSANet) to achieve efficient and accurate road extraction. First, we introduce the efficient strip transformer module (ESTM) to efficiently capture the global context to model the long-distance dependence required by long roads. Second, we design a geometric deformation estimation module (GDEM) to adaptively extract the context from the shape deformation caused by shooting roads from different perspectives. Third, we provide a simple but effective road edge focal loss (REF loss) to make …
