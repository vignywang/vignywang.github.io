  Accurate lung lesion segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images is crucial to the analysis and diagnosis of lung diseases, such as COVID-19 and lung cancer. However, the smallness and variety of lung nodules and the lack of high-quality labeling make the accurate lung nodule segmentation difficult. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel segmentation mask named “ soft mask,” which has richer and more accurate edge details description and better visualization, and develop a universal automatic soft mask annotation pipeline to deal with different datasets correspondingly. Then, a novel network with detailed representation transfer and soft mask supervision (DSNet) is proposed to process the input low-resolution images of lung nodules into high-quality segmentation results. Our DSNet contains a special detailed representation transfer module (DRTM) for reconstructing the detailed …
