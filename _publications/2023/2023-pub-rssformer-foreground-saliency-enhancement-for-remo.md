abstract: >-
  High spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images contain complex foreground-background relationships, which makes the remote sensing land cover segmentation a special semantic segmentation task. The main challenges come from the large-scale variation, complex background samples and imbalanced foreground-background distribution. These issues make recent context modeling methods sub-optimal due to the lack of foreground saliency modeling. To handle these problems, we propose a Remote Sensing Segmentation framework (RSSFormer), including Adaptive TransFormer Fusion Module, Detail-aware Attention Layer and Foreground Saliency Guided Loss. Specifically, from the perspective of relation-based foreground saliency modeling, our Adaptive Transformer Fusion Module can adaptively suppress background noise and enhance object saliency when fusing multi-scale features. Then our …
