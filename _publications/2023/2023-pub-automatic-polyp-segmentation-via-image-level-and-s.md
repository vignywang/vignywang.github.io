abstract: >-
  More than 95% of colorectal cancers are gradually transformed from polyps, so regular colonoscopy polyp examination plays an important role in cancer prevention and early treatment. However, automatic polyp segmentation remains a challenging task due to the low-contrast tissue environment and the small size and variety (e.g., shape, color, texture) of polyps. In this case, the rich context information in colonoscopy images is worth exploring to address the above issues. On the one hand, the image-level context with a global receptive field can be used to enhance the discrimination between the foreground and the background to alleviate the occult and indistinguishability of polyps in colonoscopy images. On the other hand, the surrounding-level context focused on the surrounding pathological region of the polyp has more detailed features that are beneficial for polyp segmentation. Therefore, we propose a novel …
