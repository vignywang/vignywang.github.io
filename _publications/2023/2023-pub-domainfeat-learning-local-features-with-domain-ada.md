  Accurate and efficient keypoint detection and description is a fundamental step in various computer vision tasks. In this paper, we extract robust descriptors and detect accurate keypoints by learning local Features with Domain adaptation (DomainFeat). Specifically, our Domainfeat includes image-level domain invariance supervision, pixel-level domain consistency supervision, Pixel-Adaptive keypoint Detection(PA-Det), and cross-domain dataset with domain stable point supervision. First, we introduce the image-level domain invariance supervision to make the high-level feature distributions from different domains close by fusing domain-invariant representations in the decoder. Furthermore, to compensate for the inconsistency between descriptors corresponding to the keypoints at the pixel level, we propose the pixel-level domain consistency supervision. Then we present the Pixel-Adaptive keypoint Detection to …
