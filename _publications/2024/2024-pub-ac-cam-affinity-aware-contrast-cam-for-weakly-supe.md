  Applying the latest visual transformer (ViT) to Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) can compensate for the local perception limitations of CNN, but it also brings about the over-smoothing problem, that is, the final patch labels tend to be uniform. To overcome this challenge, we present an Affinity-Aware Contrast Class Activation Maps (AC-CAM) framework aimed at enhancing WSSS for MRI Brain Tumor analysis by exploiting only image-level labels. We propose two main components: the Affinity-Aware Token Contrast Module (ATCM) and the Affinity-Aware Refine Module (ARM). ATCM utilizes semantic affinities from attention maps to improve the contrast between patch tokens, effectively reducing the over-smoothing tendency of Vision Transformers (ViT). ARM refines the pseudo labels further, incorporating RGB and affinity information to capture the intricate details of the target objects. Our approach …
