  Accurate segmentation of colorectal polyps in colonoscopy images is crucial for effective diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, current deep learning-based methods primarily rely on fusing RGB information across multiple scales, leading to limitations in accurately identifying polyps due to restricted RGB domain information and challenges in feature misalignment during multi-scale aggregation. To address these limitations, we propose the Polyp Segmentation Network with Shunted Transformer (PSTNet), a novel approach that integrates both RGB and frequency domain cues present in the images. PSTNet comprises three key modules: the Frequency Characterization Attention Module (FCAM) for extracting frequency cues and capturing polyp characteristics, the Feature Supplementary Alignment Module (FSAM) for aligning semantic information and reducing misalignment noise, and …
