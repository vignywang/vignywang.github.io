  Gait recognition aims to identify individuals at a distance based on their biometric gait patterns. While offering flexibility in network input, existing set-based methods often overlook the potential of fine-grained local feature by solely utilizing global gait feature and fail to fully exploit the communication between silhouette-level and set-level features. To alleviate this issue, we propose Gait Refined Lateral Network(GRLN), featuring plug-and-play Adaptive Feature Refinement modules (AFR) that extract discriminative features progressively from silhouette-level and set-level representations in a coarse-to-fine manner at various network depths. AFR can be widely applied in set-based gait recognition models to substantially enhance their gait recognition performance. To align with the extracted refined features, we introduce Horizontal Stable Mapping (HSM), a novel mapping technique that reduces model parameters …
