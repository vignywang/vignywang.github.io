  Encoder-decoder architectures have demonstrated remarkable success in semantic segmentation across various domains. This paper explores the translational robustness of such architectures, specifically their ability to handle in object position shifts. We find that weak-stationarity in these networks leads to imprecise positional information being fused in the decoder, making them insensitive to small-range object translations and resulting in inaccurate segmentation outputs. We empirically validate this weak-stationarity theory. We then re-analyze the benefits of common practices for improving absolute performance, such as data augmentation, deep supervision, and skip-layer designs, in the context of translational robustness. Finally, we propose a light-weight training strategy that achieves translational robustness comparable to traditional data-augmentation-heavy methods, even under constrained training conditions.
