  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is a challenging multimedia task that requires segmentation and recognition of unseen word classes during the testing phase. Recent works bridge the gap between closed and open-vocabulary recognition by introducing large-scale visual language models such as CLIP with cross-modal alignment capabilities. To preserve multimodal alignment capabilities, it is common to freeze the parameters of the CLIP and then add additional learnable components such as adapters to expand to downstream tasks. However, for the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation task, the plain adapter suffers from overfitting the closed-vocabulary classes and impairs performance on the open-vocabulary unseen classes. In addition, since CLIP is trained to perform image-level alignment can cause the network to over-focus on partially discriminative regions, resulting in incomplete …
