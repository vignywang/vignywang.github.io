  The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a visual method that allows users to interact with computers and mobile devices. Nowadays, users rely on GUI for completing some tasks, such as browsing web or using mobile applications. Users often meet some needs such as setting an alarm for 8:00 AM to wake them up and checking the weather for tomorrow. Some commercial agents have been integrated into users personal phones to help the user accomplish a series of basic tasks. Unfortunately, these commercial agents often relied on fixed templates or program scripts to ensure reliability. This also limited their functionality to some basic system applications. Recently large language models (LLMs) have made significant breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP). Astonishingly, LLMs have demonstrated not only a strong ability to understand and generate text but also planning and reasoning capabilities. Some researchers have considered using LLMs as the agent’s brain, equipping these agents with corresponding capabilities. LLM-based agents are also being applied to help users automate tasks on their personal phones and computers. These agents often can understand the GUI environment on personal phones and computers, allowing them to make decisions to complete tasks. This is also the origin of the term “GUI Agent”. Our review surveys recent research on LLM-based GUI Agents. We summarize the capabilities of existing GUI Agents and also discuss the GUI Agent task automation pipeline. A comprehensive list of studies in this paper will be available at a GitHub repositories.
