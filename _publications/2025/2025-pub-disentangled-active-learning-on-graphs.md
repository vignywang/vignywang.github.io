  Active learning on graphs (ALG) has emerged as a compelling research field due to its capacity to address the challenge of label scarcity. Existing ALG methods incorporate diversity into their query strategies to maximize the gains from node sampling, improving robustness and reducing redundancy in graph learning. However, they often overlook the complex entanglement of latent factors inherent in graph-structured data. This oversight can lead to a sampling process that fails to ensure diversity at a finer-grained level, thereby missing the opportunity to sample more valuable nodes. To this end, we propose a novel approach, Disentangled Active Learning on Graphs (DALG). In this work, we first design the Disenconv-AL layer to learn disentangled feature embedding, then construct the influence graph for each node and create a dedicated ”memory list” to store the resultant influence weights. On this basis, our …
