  Open vocabulary 3D instance segmentation aims to align 3D instance segmentation results with natural language text, thereby achieving semantic prediction without relying on predefined class labels for specific scenes, which has been widely used in the field of multimedia. Current open vocabulary 3D instance segmentation methods mainly rely on 2D masks provided by various 2D segmentation foundation models. However, in complex scenes, the calculation of 2D masks often struggles to balance over-segmentation of large objects and under-segmentation of small objects. In this paper, we introduce OV-BIS, a novel zero-shot open vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method that leverages instance boundary information to improve 3D semantic segmentation performance. The key insight of our method is that the edge map as 3D boundary projection is suitable for multi-scale tasks and capable of …
