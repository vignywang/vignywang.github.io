  Label Distribution Learning (LDL) is a novel machine learning paradigm that addresses the problem of label ambiguity and has found widespread applications. However, obtaining complete label distributions in real-world scenarios is challenging, which has led to the emergence of Incomplete Label Distribution Learning (InLDL). Existing InLDL methods attempt to utilize low-rank label correlations to recover the complete label distribution. However, we find that real-world LDL datasets have an imbalanced nature; that is, the sum of the description degrees for normal labels is significantly larger than that for tail labels, which disrupts the low-rank assumption underlying the recovery of the label distribution. To solve the above problem, we propose Incomplete and Imbalance Label Distribution Learning (I2LDL), which makes the use of low-rank label correlations more reasonable for InLDL. Our method decomposes the …
