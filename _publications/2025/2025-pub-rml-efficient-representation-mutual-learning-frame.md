  Research on efficient semantic segmentation models is increasing the number of instrumentation and measurement applications. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of end-to-end solutions for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels. Previous end-to-end methods lack adequate interaction of multilevel representation information and typically rely on a segmentation branch and a pseudolabel segmentation loss to predict segmentation masks, leading to increased time consumption and parameter count. In this article, we propose an effective representation mutual learning (RML) framework to directly predict segmentation masks. This framework leverages collaborative learning and mutual teaching among multilevel features to improve segmentation performance. Our RML incorporates the category-level, feature-level, and pixel-level RML …
