  Point cloud analysis is a fundamental task in computer vision. Transformer-based methods are increasingly popular in point cloud analysis due to their strong global context modeling ability, but they have limitations in capturing local geometric features. Recently, Mamba-based methods have emerged with comparable performance and better efficiency, yet they fall short in modeling global context like Transformer. In addition, Mamba’s ability to capture local geometric features has not been fully exploited. How to fully exploit Mamba’s geometric modeling capability while integrating the strengths of both architectures is a point worth exploring. In this paper, we propose a hybrid point cloud analysis framework combining Transformer and Mamba to jointly learn local geometric features and global contextual features. The unordered nature of point clouds prevents Mamba from effectively extracting local geometric …
