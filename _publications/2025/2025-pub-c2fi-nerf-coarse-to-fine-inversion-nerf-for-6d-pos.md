  Estimating the 6DoF pose of objects in complex scenarios is one of the core challenges in environmental perception for unmanned systems. Recently, mesh-free pose estimation methods based on “inverse” NeRF have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy under ideal data conditions compared to traditional methods. However, the overall performance of this strategy is suboptimal due to some overlooked details, such as NeRF’s sampling of pixel backpropagation, which can lead to local minima in high-resolution images. Random initialization of poses increases the difficulty of network convergence and estimation bias. Pose estimation neglects geometric consistency constraints, resulting in low robustness to occluded environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes a “coarse-to-fine” NeRF pose prediction framework (C2Fi-NeRF). During the training phase, an affinity-based full-pixel …
