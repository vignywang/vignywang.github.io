  Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance systems, particularly in military defense, maritime monitoring, and early warning applications. Despite its strategic importance, ISTD remains challenging due to two fundamental limitations: targets typically occupy less than 0.15% of the image area and exhibit low distinguishability from complex backgrounds. While recent advances in deep learning have shown promise, existing methods struggle with information loss during downsampling and inefficient modeling of global context. This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework that synergistically integrates SAM2’s hierarchical feature learning with Mamba’s selective sequence modeling to address these challenges. Our key innovations include: (1)Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) that enables efficient domain adaptation from natural to infrared imagery by employing a dual-stage …
