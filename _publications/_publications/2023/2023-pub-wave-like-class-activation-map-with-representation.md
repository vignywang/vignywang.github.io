  The Class Activation Map (CAM) is widely used to generate pseudo-labels for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), while it does not adequately consider the modeling of foreground-independent information, resulting in prone to false positive pixels. In this paper, we propose a Wave-like Class Activation Map (WaveCAM) from the perspective of representation fusion and dynamic aggregation representation to alleviate the above problem. Specifically, our WaveCAM includes the foreground-aware representation modeling that enhances perception of foreground information, and the foreground-independent representation modeling that enhances perception of foreground-independent information, and a representation-adaptive fusion module that fuses the two representations. Both representations are expressed as wave functions with amplitude and phase to dynamically aggregate representations …
