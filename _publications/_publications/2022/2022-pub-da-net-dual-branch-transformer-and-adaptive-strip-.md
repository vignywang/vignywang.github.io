  Since the morphology of retinal vessels plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis of eye-related diseases and diabetic retinopathy, retinal vessels segmentation is an indispensable step for the screening and diagnosis of retinal diseases, yet it is still a challenging problem due to the complex structure of retinal vessels. Current retinal vessels segmentation approaches roughly fall into image-level and patches-level methods based on the input type, while each has its own strengths and weaknesses. To benefit from both of the input forms, we introduce a Dual Branch Transformer Module (DBTM) that can simultaneously and fully enjoy the patches-level local information and the image-level global context. Besides, the retinal vessels are long-span, thin, and distributed in strips, making the square kernel of classic convolutional neural network false as it is only suitable for most natural objects with bulk shape. To better …
