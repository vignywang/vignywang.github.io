  In medical intelligence applications, the labeling of medical data is crucial and expensive, so it becomes urgent to explore labeling-efficient ways to train applications. Semi-supervised techniques for medical image segmentation have demonstrated potential, effectively training models using scarce labeled data alongside a wealth of unlabeled data. Therefore, semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a key issue in engineering applications of medical intelligence. Consistency constraints based on prototype alignment provide an intuitively sensible way to discover valuable insights from unlabeled data that can motivate segmentation performance. In this work, we propose a Dual prototypes Contrastive Network to motivate semi-supervised medical segmentation accuracy by imposing image-level global prototype and pixel-level local prototype constraints. First, we introduce a Background-Separation Global …
