  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. However, these models often generate descriptions containing objects or details not present in the input image, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ''hallucination''. Existing methods focus solely on single-side hallucination mitigation: Intra-modal-only reinforcement (e.g. visual attention enhancement) ignores prompt-based guidance; Inter-modal-only correlation correction may introduce low-information visual tokens to mislead reasoning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dual-Modal Collaborative Attention Reinforcement (DuCAR). Specifically, DuCAR is equipped with intra-visual CLS-driven sampling and cross-modal dynamic sampling, extracting important visual tokens guided by intra- and inter-modal joint information. During the multimodal fusion …
