  Local feature detection and description play an important role in many computer vision tasks, which are designed to detect and describe keypoints in any scene and any downstream task. Data-driven local feature learning methods need to rely on pixel-level correspondence for training. However, a vast number of existing approaches ignored the semantic information on which humans rely to describe image pixels. In addition, it is not feasible to enhance generic scene keypoints detection and description simply by using traditional common semantic segmentation models because they can only recognize a limited number of coarse-grained object classes. In this paper, we propose SAMFeat to introduce SAM (segment anything model), a foundation model trained on 11 million images, as a teacher to guide local feature learning. SAMFeat learns additional semantic information brought by SAM and thus is inspired by …
