  Current Online Knowledge Distillation (OKD) methods primarily employ adversarial learning strategies to facilitate mutual learning of intermediate features among student networks. However, these methods still face two major challenges: first, in scenarios where multiple student networks serve as mutual teachers, poor performance of one student network can easily lead to mutual collapse of the learning pattern; second, individual student networks suffer from limited representational capacity and insufficient feature richness. In this work, we propose an Online Knowledge Distillation optimizatione based on Multi-Student Model Multi-Task Collaborative Learning, which enables two student networks to construct representation spaces of varying richness and guides this differentiated representation learning through designing different auxiliary tasks for each student network, effectively improving the richness and generalization capability of student networks. Furthermore, to effectively integrate the unique advantages established by each student network, we innovatively introduce a” Collaborative Processing Module (CPM)” in the online teacher construction method. Through its feature integration mechanism, this module can simultaneously capture and fuse the advantageous features learned by both student networks through their respective auxiliary tasks, thereby achieving bidirectional diffusion of advantages between networks. This approach not only avoids confusion in representation spaces but also achieves mutual benefits between student networks. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted extensive classification …
