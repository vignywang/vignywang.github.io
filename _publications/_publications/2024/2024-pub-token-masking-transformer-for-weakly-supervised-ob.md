  Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is both a promising and challenging task that aims to achieve object localization exclusively through image category labels for supervision. Visual transformers have recently been applied to WSOL, demonstrating significant success through the exploitation of long-range feature dependencies in self-attention mechanisms. However, the transformer-based approach suffers from the same partial activation problem as the CNN-based approach due to the use of the classification task to train self-attention map, i.e., only a few discriminative regions are assigned high attention response and thus the localization map does not cover the whole object. To alleviate this problem, we propose a plug-and-play Token Masking Transformer (TMT) method to help transformer-based WSOL methods to obtain a more complete localization map by dynamic discriminative token masking …
