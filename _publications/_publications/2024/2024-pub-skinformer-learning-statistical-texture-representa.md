  Accurate skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopic images is of great importance for skin cancer diagnosis. However, automatic segmentation of melanoma remains a challenging task because it is difficult to incorporate useful texture representations into the learning process. Texture representations are not only related to the local structural information learned by CNN, but also include the global statistical texture information of the input image. In this paper, we propose a transFormer network (SkinFormer) that efficiently extracts and fuses statistical texture representation for Skin lesion segmentation. Specifically, to quantify the statistical texture of input features, a Kurtosis-guided Statistical Counting Operator is designed. We propose Statistical Texture Fusion Transformer and Statistical Texture Enhance Transformer with the help of Kurtosis-guided Statistical Counting Operator by utilizing the transformer's global …
