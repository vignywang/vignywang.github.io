  The complementarity between camera and LiDAR data makes fusion methods a promising approach to improve 3D semantic segmentation performance. Recent transformer-based methods have also demonstrated superiority in segmentation. However, multimodal solutions incorporating transformers are underexplored and face two key inherent difficulties: over-attention and noise from different modal data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Deformable Multimodal Representation Fusion (DefFusion) framework consisting mainly of a Deformable Representation Fusion Transformer and Dynamic Representation Augmentation Modules. The Deformable Representation Fusion Transformer introduces the deformable mechanism in multimodal fusion, avoiding over-attention and improving efficiency by adaptively modeling a 2D key/value set for a given 3D query, thus enabling multimodal fusion with higher …
